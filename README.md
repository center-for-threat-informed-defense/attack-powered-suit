## Features

### Search

Powered Suit puts the MITRE ATT&CK® knowledge base at your fingertips. Instantly

ATT&CK Powered Suit is created by the Center for Threat-Informed Defense and
released for free (and with open source code) in service of our mission: to
advance the state of the art and the state of the practice in threat-informed
defense globally.

The Center for Threat-Informed Defense does not collect or share any data about users or
their usage of ATT&CK Powered Suit. Search queries and other features are performed
locally in the browser. (Your bookmarks and settings may be synchronized to the cloud by
your browser vendor.)

### Deep Links

If you see an ATT&CK technique referenced without a link, you can right click
and jump straight to it.

![animated gif showing how to right-click and deep link to ATT&CK
site](./media/context-menu.gif)

Or right-click on a phrase on any web page and click "Search ATT&CK for …" to
find ATT&CK objects matching that phrase.

### Omnibar

Search for ATT&CK objects directly from the browser's omnibar by typing an ampersand
and then a space.

bar](./media/omnibar.gif)

If you see the technique you want, click on it to jump directly to that page.
Otherwise, choose "Search in ATT&CK" to view the search results.

### …And More

* One-click text snippets from ATT&CK search results for quick integration into
  your notes or reports.
* Bookmark techniques that you use frequently or are collecting for a research
  assignment.
* Export bookmarks to ATT&CK navigator for visualization and presentation.
